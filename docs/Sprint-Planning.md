# OpnLaaS Sprint Planning

## Sprint Goal

**Goal:** Enable students and faculty to manage resources through a web interface, and create virtual machines on proxmox.

**Specific Goal:** Create a resource management dashboard in the web UI, and allow users to interface with proxmox so they are able to create/manage VMs.

**Stretch Goal:** Implement logging to keep track of changes to virtual machines.

### Selected Stories

-   Feature 1: User & Resource Dashboard
    -   As a Researcher, I want to be able to reserve and manage computational resources for my projects so I can focus on other aspects of my work instead of spending time manually setting up hosts.
    -   As a Student, I want to view and book available resources so that I can get my projects deployed easily.
-   Feature 2: Virtualization Integration
    -   As a System Architect, I want to integrate with Proxmox API to automate VM and container lifecycle management so that users can quickly deploy virtualized environments.
    -   As an Instructor, I want to be able to easily create several virtual machines for low compute tasks so that i can make several lightweight hosts for classes.
