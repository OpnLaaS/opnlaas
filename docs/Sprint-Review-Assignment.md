## Backlog review

Review the stories and work items selected for the sprint.  

Completed stories have all work tasks done and tested, e.g.:
* backend work / unit tests
* frontend work / user tests
* integration work / integration tests.

You're not required to have anything deployed yet.

## Demo

Key points:

* Audience is your grader - someone who is familiar with the project
* Demo by story, then by developer (backend/frontend). Each individual should present their own work.
* Demo only the two stories you've finished - don't show work from partially completed stories unless you haven't finished two.

Mechanics:

* The demo should be very concise (~5 min).  
* Create a Teams meeting, record, share your screen.  Make sure that you plan before you record.  

### Story X

* Intro:

  - Describe the story that is being demoed / tested.
  - (You can show backend or frontend first - up to you)

* Backend demo (internal or external API)
  - **Introduce yourself**
  - show testing script(s) and explain what is being tested
    - e.g. unittests that are executing your API functions (internal) OR calling your API endpoints (external)
  - run test(s) and show results
  
* frontend demo:
  - **Introduce yourself**
  - show testing script(s) and explain what is being tested
    - e.g. written instructions for a user to complete one or more stories, or (optionally) automated UI tests
  - demonstrate the story by follow the instructions 

### Story Y

* etc.
